# Views
You manage a database of social network users.  

Here is the **users** table with details:

![[cp4n8vg3.bmp]]

Write a query to create a view to show only 'acc_id' and 'status' columns and then show that view.

>ðŸ›ˆ Don't forget to name the view and use the **AS** keyword.

---

```mysql
CREATE VIEW List AS
SELECT acc_id, status
FROM users;
SELECT * FROM List
```
