# Joining Tables
All of the queries shown up until now have selected from just one table at a time.  
  
One of the most beneficial features of SQL is the ability to combine data from two or more tables.  
  
In the two tables that follow, the table named **customers** stores information about customers:

The **orders** table stores information about individual orders with their corresponding amount:

>ğŸ›ˆ In SQL, "**joining tables**" means combining data from two or more tables. A table join creates a **temporary table** showing the data from the joined tables.

# Joining Tables
Rather than storing the customer name in both tables, the **orders** table contains a reference to the **customer ID** that appears in the customers table. This approach is more efficient, as opposed to storing the same text values in both tables.  
In order to be able to select the corresponding data from both tables, we will need to **join** them on that condition.

# Joining Tables
To join the two tables, specify them as a comma-separated list in the FROM clause:

```sql
SELECT customers.ID, customers.Name, orders.Name, orders.Amount
FROM customers, orders
WHERE customers.ID=orders.customer_ID
ORDER BY customers.ID
```

>ğŸ›ˆ Each table contains "ID" and "Name" columns, so in order to select the correct ID and Name, **fully qualified names** are used.

Note that the WHERE clause "joins" the tables on the condition that the **ID** from the **customers** table should be equal to the **customer_ID** of the **orders** table.  
  
**Result:**

The returned data shows customer orders and their corresponding amount.
