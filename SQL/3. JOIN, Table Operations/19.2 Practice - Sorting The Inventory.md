# INNER JOIN
You are working at a supermarket and you need to arrange products by categories. You are given the following tables:  
  
**products:**

![[u8n2sy8x.bmp]]

**categories:**

![[jugvatbk.bmp]]

Each product has a category.  

Write a query to output all products with their categories (productname-price-categoryname) in one table.

>ðŸ›ˆ Don't forget about the **ON** keyword while using **INNER JOIN**.

---

```mysql
SELECT products.productname, products.price, categories.categoryname
FROM products INNER JOIN categories
ON products.categoryid = categories.id;
```
