Each product has a category.  

Write a query to output all products with their categories (productname-price-categoryname) in one table.

>ðŸ›ˆ Don't forget about the **ON** keyword while using **INNER JOIN**.

```mysql
SELECT products.productname, products.price, categories.categoryname
FROM products INNER JOIN categories
ON products.categoryid = categories.id;
```
