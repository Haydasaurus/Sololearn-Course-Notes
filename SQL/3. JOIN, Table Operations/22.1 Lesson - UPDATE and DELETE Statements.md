# Updating Data
The **UPDATE** statement allows us to alter data in the table.  
  
The basic syntax of an **UPDATE** query with a **WHERE** clause is as follows:

```sql
UPDATE table_name  
SET column1=value1, column2=value2, ...  
WHERE condition;
```

You specify the column and its new value in a comma-separated list after the **SET** keyword.

>ðŸ›ˆ If you omit the WHERE clause, **all** records in the table will be updated!

# Updating Data
Consider the following table called "Employees":

To update John's salary, we can use the following query:

```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary=5000
WHERE ID=1;
```

**Result:**

# Updating Multiple Columns
It is also possible to UPDATE **multiple columns** at the same time by comma-separating them:

```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary=5000, FirstName='Robert'
WHERE ID=1;
```

**Result:**

>ðŸ›ˆ You can specify the column order any way you like in the SET clause.

# Deleting Data
The **DELETE** statement is used to remove data from your table. DELETE queries work much like UPDATE queries.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name  
WHERE condition;
```

For example, you can delete a specific employee from the table:

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE ID=1;
```

**Result:**

>ðŸ›ˆ If you omit the WHERE clause, **all** records in the table will be deleted!

>The DELETE statement removes the data from the table permanently.
