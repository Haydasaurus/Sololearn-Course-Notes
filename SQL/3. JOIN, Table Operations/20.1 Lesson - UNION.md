# Set Operation
Occasionally, you might need to combine data from multiple tables into one comprehensive dataset. This may be for tables with similar data within the same database or maybe there is a need to combine similar data across databases or even across servers.  
  
To accomplish this, use the **UNION** and **UNION ALL** operators.  
  
**UNION** combines multiple datasets into a single dataset, and removes any existing duplicates.  

**UNION ALL** combines multiple datasets into one dataset, but does not remove duplicate rows.

>ğŸ›ˆ UNION ALL is faster than UNION, as it does not perform the duplicate removal operation over the data set.

# UNION
The **UNION** operator is used to combine the result-sets of two or more SELECT statements.  
  
All SELECT statements within the UNION must have the **same number of columns**. The columns must also have the same **data types**. Also, the columns in each SELECT statement must be in the same order.  

**The syntax of UNION is as follows:**

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1  
UNION  
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

Here is the **First** of two tables:

And here is the **Second**:

```sql
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, City FROM First
UNION
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, City FROM Second;
```

The resulting table will look like this one:

>ğŸ›ˆ As you can see, the duplicates have been removed.

**TIP:**  If your columns don't match exactly across all queries, you can use a **NULL (or any other)** value such as:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Company FROM businessContacts
UNION
SELECT FirstName, LastName, NULL FROM otherContacts;
```

>ğŸ›ˆ The UNION operator is used to combine the result-sets of two or more SELECT statements.

# UNION ALL
**UNION ALL** selects all rows from each table and combines them into a single table.  
  
The following SQL statement uses UNION ALL to select data from the **First** and **Second** tables:

```mysql
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, City FROM First
UNION ALL
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, City FROM Second;
```

**The resulting table:**

>ğŸ›ˆ As you can see, the result set includes the duplicate rows as well.
