# Creating a Table
You need to make a **leaderboard** for a video game.  
It should have the following columns:  

- place (INT)  
- nickname (VARCHAR)  
- rating (INT)  
  
Write a query to **create** this table and **insert** the following top 3 players:  

1, Predator, 9500  
2, JohnWar, 9300  
3, NightWarrior, 8900  
  
Finally, **show the resulting table**.

>🛈 Recall the **INSERT** statement to add the required data to the table.

---

```sql
CREATE TABLE leaderboard (
Place int,
Nickname VARCHAR(128),
Rating Int);

INSERT INTO leaderboard (Place, Nickname, Rating)
VALUES
(1, 'Predator', 9500),
(2, 'JohnWar', 9300),
(3, 'NightWarrior', 8900);

SELECT * FROM leaderboard
```
