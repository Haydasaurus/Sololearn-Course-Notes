# SQL Constraints
SQL **constraints** are used to specify rules for table data.  
  
**The following are commonly used SQL constraints:**  

**NOT NULL** - Indicates that a column cannot contain any NULL value.  

**UNIQUE** - Does not allow to insert a duplicate value in a column. The UNIQUE constraint maintains the uniqueness of a column in a table. More than one UNIQUE column can be used in a table. 

**PRIMARY KEY** - Enforces the table to accept unique data for a specific column and this constraint create a unique index for accessing the table faster.  

**CHECK** - Determines whether the value is valid or not from a logical expression.  

**DEFAULT** - While inserting data into a table, if no value is supplied to a column, then the column gets the value set as DEFAULT.  
  
For example, the following means that the **name** column disallows NULL values.

```sql
name varchar(100) NOT NULL
```

# AUTO INCREMENT
Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated when a new record is inserted into a table.  
  
Often, we would like the value of the primary key field to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.  
  
By default, the starting value for AUTO_INCREMENT is 1, and it will increment by 1 for each new record.  

Let's set the UserID field to be a primary key that automatically generates a new value:

```mysql
UserID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,  
PRIMARY KEY (UserID)
```

# Using Constraints
The example below demonstrates how to create a table using constraints.

```mysql
CREATE TABLE Users (  
id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,  
username varchar(40) NOT NULL,  
password varchar(10) NOT NULL,  
PRIMARY KEY(id)  
);
```

The following SQL enforces that the "id", "username", and "password" columns do not accept NULL values. We also define the "id" column to be an auto-increment primary key field.  
  
**Here is the result:**
