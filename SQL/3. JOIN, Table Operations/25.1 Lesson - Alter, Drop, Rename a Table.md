# ALTER TABLE
The **ALTER TABLE** command is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.  

You would also use the ALTER TABLE command to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.  
  
Consider the following table called **People**:

![[ghylrwn9.bmp]]

The following SQL code adds a new column named DateOfBirth

```mysql
ALTER TABLE People ADD DateOfBirth date;
```

**Result:**

![[21hfrgb4.bmp]]

>ğŸ›ˆ All rows will have the default value in the newly added column, which, in this case, is NULL.

---

# Dropping
The following SQL code demonstrates how to delete the column named _DateOfBirth_ in the People table.

```mysql
ALTER TABLE People
DROP COLUMN DateOfBirth;
```

**The People table will now look like this:**

![[q4xvqytl.bmp]]

>ğŸ›ˆ The column, along with all of its data, will be completely removed from the table.

To delete the entire table, use the **DROP TABLE** command:

```sql
DROP TABLE People;
```

>ğŸ›ˆ Be careful when dropping a table. Deleting a table will result in the complete loss of the information stored in the table!

# Renaming
The ALTER TABLE command is also used to rename columns: 

```mysql
ALTER TABLE People
RENAME FirstName TO name;
```

This query will rename the column called FirstName to name.\

**Result:**

![[84v914wv.bmp]]

**Renaming Tables**  
  
You can rename the entire table using the **RENAME** command:

```mysql
RENAME TABLE People TO Users;
```

>ğŸ›ˆ This will rename the table People to Users.
