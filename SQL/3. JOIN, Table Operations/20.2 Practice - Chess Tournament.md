Write a query to merge 'NorwayChess' and 'TataSteel' tables. Then order the merged table by 'Rating' in descending order and show the final table of participants.

>ðŸ›ˆ Remember, you need to get a table **without duplicates**.

```sql
SELECT * FROM norwaychess
UNION
SELECT * FROM tatasteel
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```
