# UNION
FIDE wants to hold a major chess tournament and has decided to include players from the **Norway Chess** and **Tata Steel** tournaments.  

Table **NorwayChess**

![[apwipd9t.bmp]]

Table **TataSteel**

![[lqk5qssa.bmp]]

Write a query to merge 'NorwayChess' and 'TataSteel' tables. Then order the merged table by 'Rating' in descending order and show the final table of participants.
