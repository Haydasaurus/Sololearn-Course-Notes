# Custom Names
Custom names can be used for tables as well. You can shorten the join statements by giving the tables "nicknames":

```sql
SELECT ct.ID, ct.Name, ord.Name, ord.Amount  
FROM customers AS ct, orders AS ord  
WHERE ct.ID=ord.Customer_ID  
ORDER BY ct.ID;
```

>ğŸ›ˆ As you can see, we shortened the table names as we used them in our query.

# Types of Join
The following are the types of JOIN that can be used in MySQL:  
**- INNER** JOIN  
**- LEFT** JOIN  
**- RIGHT** JOIN  
  
INNER JOIN is equivalent to JOIN. It returns rows when there is a match between the tables.  

**Syntax:**

```mysql
SELECT column_name(s)  
FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2  
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;
```

Note the **ON** keyword for specifying the inner join condition.

>ğŸ›ˆ Only the records matching the join condition are returned.

# LEFT JOIN
The **LEFT JOIN** returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.  
  
This means that if there are no matches for the **ON** clause in the table on the right, the join will still return the rows from the first table in the result.  
  
**The basic syntax of LEFT JOIN is as follows:**

```mysql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...  
FROM table1 LEFT OUTER JOIN table2  
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

>ğŸ›ˆ The **OUTER** keyword is optional, and can be omitted.

The image below demonstrates how LEFT JOIN works:

![[ndsr1mki.bmp]]

Consider the following tables.  

**customers:**

![[5w9s4sar.bmp]]

**items:**

![[xy4y2k5w.bmp]]

The following SQL statement will return all **customers**, and the **items** they might have:

```mysql
SELECT customers.Name, items.Name  
FROM customers LEFT OUTER JOIN items  
ON customers.ID=items.Seller_id;
```

**Result:**

![[fw8dd1bk.bmp]]

The result set contains all the rows from the left table and matching data from the right table.

>ğŸ›ˆ If no match is found for a particular row, **NULL** is returned.

---

# RIGHT JOIN
The **RIGHT JOIN** returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table.

![[erzpeg3g.bmp]]

The basic syntax of RIGHT JOIN is as follows:

```mysql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...  
FROM table1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2  
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

Again, the **OUTER** keyword is optional, and can be omitted.

Consider the same example from our previous lesson, but this time with a RIGHT JOIN: 

**Result:**

![[xapqe6ls.bmp]]

The RIGHT JOIN returns all the rows from the right table (items), even if there are no matches in the left table (customers).

>ğŸ›ˆ There are other types of joins in the SQL language, but they are not supported by MySQL.
