# Deleting Data
You are manager in the supermarket.  

Here is the **products** table showing a field for each item, along with the ExpireDate with the count of days remaining before item expiration.

You need to get rid of all the expired products.  

**Delete** from the ‘products’ table all of the items whose 'ExpireDate' is less than 1 and show the table without any expired items.

>🛈 The **DELETE** statement removes the data from the table permanently.

```sql
DELETE FROM products
WHERE ExpireDate < 1;
SELECT * FROM products
```
