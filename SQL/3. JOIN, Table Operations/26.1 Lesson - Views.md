# Views
In SQL, a VIEW is a **virtual table** that is based on the result-set of an SQL statement.  
  
A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.  
  
Views allow us to:  
- Structure data in a way that users or classes of users find natural or intuitive.  
- Restrict access to the data in such a way that a user can see and (sometimes) modify exactly what they need and no more.  
- Summarize data from various tables and use it to generate reports.  
  
**To create a view:**

```mysql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS  
SELECT column_name(s)  
FROM table_name  
WHERE condition;
```

>ðŸ›ˆ The SELECT query can be as complex as you need it to be. It can contain multiple JOINS and other commands.

# Creating Views
Consider the **Employees** table, which contains the following records:

![[8rm7dyvn.bmp]]

Let's create a view that displays each employee's FirstName and Salary.

```mysql
CREATE VIEW List AS  
SELECT FirstName, Salary  
FROM Employees;
```

Now, you can query the **List** view as you would query an actual table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM List;
```

**This would produce the following result:**

![[x37pqc17.bmp]]

>ðŸ›ˆ A view always shows up-to-date data! The database engine uses the view's SQL statement to recreate the data each time a user queries a view.

# Updating a View
You can update a view by using the following syntax:

```mysql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS  
SELECT column_name(s)  
FROM table_name  
WHERE condition;
```

The example below updates our **List** view to select also the LastName:

```mysql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW List AS  
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees;
```

**Result:**

![[kef06tfz.bmp]]

```mysql
DROP VIEW List
```

>ðŸ›ˆ It is sometimes easier to drop a table and recreate it instead of using the ALTER TABLE statement to change the tableâ€™s definition.
