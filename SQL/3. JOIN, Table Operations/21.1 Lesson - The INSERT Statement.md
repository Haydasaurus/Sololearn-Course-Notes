# Inserting Data
SQL tables store data in rows, one row after another. The **INSERT INTO** statement is used to add **new rows** of data to a table in the database.  
The SQL **INSERT INTO** syntax is as follows:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name  
VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...);
```

Make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table.

Consider the following **Employees** table:

![[b22wd7e7.bmp]]

**Use the following SQL statement to insert a new row:**

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees
VALUES (8, 'Anthony', 'Young', 35);
```

The values are comma-separated and their order corresponds to the columns in the table.  

**Result:**

>ðŸ›ˆ When inserting records into a table using the SQL INSERT statement, you must provide a value for every column that does not have a default value, or does not support NULL.

# Inserting Data
Alternatively, you can specify the table's column names in the INSERT INTO statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...,columnN)  
VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...valueN);
```

column1, column2, ..., columnN are the names of the columns that you want to insert data into.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, FirstName, LastName, Age)
VALUES (8, 'Anthony', 'Young', 35);
```

**This will insert the data into the corresponding columns:**

>ðŸ›ˆ You can specify your own column order, as long as the values are specified in the same order as the columns.

# Inserting Data
It is also possible to insert data into **specific** columns only.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, FirstName, LastName)
VALUES (9, 'Samuel', 'Clark');
```

**Result:**

![[3mq0cz5a.bmp]]

>ðŸ›ˆ The _Age_ column for that row automatically became **0**, as that is its default value.
