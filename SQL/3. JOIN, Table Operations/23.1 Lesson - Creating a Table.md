# SQL Tables
A single database can house hundreds of tables, each playing its own unique role in the database schema.  
  
SQL tables are comprised of table rows and columns. Table columns are responsible for storing many different types of data, including numbers, texts, dates, and even files.  
  
The **CREATE TABLE** statement is used to create a new table.

>ğŸ›ˆ Creating a basic table involves naming the table and defining its columns and each column's data type.

# Creating a Table
The basic syntax for the CREATE TABLE statement is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name  
(  
column_name1 data_type(size),  
column_name2 data_type(size),  
column_name3 data_type(size),  
....  
columnN data_type(size)  
);
```

- The **column_names** specify the names of the columns we want to create.  
- The **data_type** parameter specifies what type of data the column can hold. For example, use **int** for whole numbers.  
- The **size** parameter specifies the maximum length of the table's column.

>ğŸ›ˆ Note the **parentheses** in the syntax.

# Creating a Table
Assume that you want to create a table called "Users" that consists of four columns: UserID, LastName, FirstName, and City.  

Use the following **CREATE TABLE** statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users  
(  
UserID int,  
FirstName varchar(100),  
LastName varchar(100),  
City varchar(100)  
);
```

>ğŸ›ˆ **varchar** is the datatype that stores characters. You specify the number of characters in the parentheses after the type. So in the example above, our fields can hold max **100** characters long text.

# Data Types
**Data types** specify the type of data for a particular column.  
  
If a column called "LastName" is going to hold names, then that particular column should have a "varchar" (variable-length character) data type.  

##### **The most common data types:**  
**Numeric**  

**INT** -A normal-sized integer that can be signed or unsigned.  

**FLOAT**(M,D) - A floating-point number that cannot be unsigned. You can optionally define the display length (M) and the number of decimals (D).  

**DOUBLE**(M,D) - A double precision floating-point number that cannot be unsigned. You can optionally define the display length (M) and the number of decimals (D).  
  
##### **Date and Time:** 
**DATE** - A date in _YYYY-MM-DD_ format.  

**DATETIME** - A date and time combination in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.  

**TIMESTAMP** - A timestamp, calculated from midnight, January 1, 1970  

**TIME** - Stores the time in HH:MM:SS format.  
  
##### **String Type:**
**CHAR**(M) - Fixed-length character string. Size is specified in parenthesis. Max 255 bytes.  

**VARCHAR**(M) - Variable-length character string. Max size is specified in parenthesis.  

**BLOB -** "Binary Large Objects" and are used to store large amounts of binary data, such as images or other types of files.  

**TEXT** - Large amount of text data.

>ğŸ›ˆ Choosing the correct data type for your columns is the key to good database design.

# Primary Key
The **UserID** is the best choice for our Users table's primary key.  
Define it as a primary key during table creation, using the **PRIMARY KEY** keyword.

```mysql
CREATE TABLE Users  
(  
UserID int,  
FirstName varchar(100),  
LastName varchar(100),  
City varchar(100),  
PRIMARY KEY(UserID)  
);
```

>ğŸ›ˆ Specify the column name in the parentheses of the PRIMARY KEY keyword.

# Creating a Table
Now, when we run the query, our table will be created in the database.

>ğŸ›ˆ You can now use **INSERT INTO** queries to insert data into the table.
