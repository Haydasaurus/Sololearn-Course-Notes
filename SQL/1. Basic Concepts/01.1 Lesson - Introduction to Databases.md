# Welcome to SQL
A **database** is a collection of data that is organized in a manner that facilitates ease of access, as well as efficient management and updating.  
  
A database is made up of **tables** that store relevant information.  
  
For example, you would use a database, if you were to create a website like YouTube, which contains a lot of information like videos, usernames, passwords, comments.

# Database Tables
A table stores and displays data in a structured format consisting of **columns** and **rows** that are similar to those seen in Excel spreadsheets.  
  
Databases often contain multiple tables, each designed for a specific purpose. For example, imagine creating a database table of **names** and **telephone numbers**.  
  
First, we would set up columns with the titles _FirstName_, _LastName_ and _TelephoneNumber_.  
  
Each table includes its own set of fields, based on the data it will store.

>ðŸ›ˆ A table has a specified number of columns but can have any number of rows.

# Primary Keys  
A primary key is a field in the table that uniquely identifies the table records.  
  
The primary key's main features:  
- It must contain a **unique value** for each row.  
- It cannot contain **NULL** values.  
  
For example, our table contains a record for each name in a phone book. The unique **ID** number would be a good choice for a primary key in the table, as there is always the chance for more than one person to have the same name.

# What is SQL?
Once you understand what a database is, understanding SQL is easy. **SQL** stands for **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage.  
  
**SQL** is used to access and manipulate a **database**.  

**MySQL** is a **program** that understands **SQL**.  
  
SQL can:  
- insert, update, or delete records in a database.  
- create new databases, tables, stored procedures and views.  
- retrieve data from a database, etc.

>ðŸ›ˆ SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, but there are different versions of the SQL language.  
>
>Most SQL database programs have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard, but all of them support the major commands.
