# The DISTINCT Keyword
In situations in which you have multiple duplicate records in a table, it might make more sense to return only unique records, instead of fetching the duplicates.  
  
The SQL **DISTINCT** keyword is used in conjunction with SELECT to eliminate all duplicate records and return only unique ones.  
  
**The basic syntax of DISTINCT is as follows:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name1, column_name2
FROM table_name;
```

**See the customers table below:**

Note that there are duplicate **City** names. The following SQL statement selects only distinct values from the City column:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT City FROM customers;
```

This would produce the following result. Duplicate entries have been removed.

# The LIMIT Keyword
By default, all results that satisfy the conditions specified in the SQL statement are returned. However, sometimes we need to retrieve just a subset of records. In MySQL, this is accomplished by using the **LIMIT** keyword.  
  
**The syntax for LIMIT is as follows:**

```sql
SELECT column list
FROM table_name
LIMIT [number of records;]
```

For example, we can retrieve the first **five** records from the **customers** table.

```sql
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, City
FROM customers LIMIT 5;
```

**This would produce the following result:**

# The LIMIT Keyword
You can also pick up a set of records from a particular **offset**.  

In the following example, we pick up **four** records, starting from the **third** position:

```mysql
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, City
FROM customers OFFSET 3 LIMIT 4;
```

**This would produce the following result:**

>ðŸ›ˆ The reason that it produces results starting from ID number four, and not three, is that MySQL starts counting from **zero**, meaning that the offset of the first row is 0, not 1.
