# Basic SQL Commands
The SQL **SHOW** statement displays information contained in the database and its tables. This helpful tool lets you keep track of your database contents and remind yourself about the structure of your tables.  

For example, the **SHOW DATABASES** command lists the databases managed by the server.

```mysql
SHOW DATABASES
```

Throughout the tutorial we will be using the MySQL engine and the PHPMyAdmin tool to run SQL queries.

>ğŸ›ˆ The easiest way to get MySQL and PHPMyAdmin is to install free tools like **XAMPP** or **WAMP**, which include all necessary installers.

**Field**: column name  
**Type**: column data type  
**Key**: indicates whether the column is indexed  
**Default**: default value assigned to the column  
**Extra**: may contain any additional information that is available about a given column

# SELECT Statement  
The **SELECT** statement is used to select data from a database.  
The result is stored in a result table, which is called the **result-set**.  
  
A **query** may retrieve information from selected columns or from all columns in the table.  
To create a simple SELECT statement, specify the name(s) of the column(s) you need from the table.  
  
**Syntax of the SQL SELECT Statement:**

```sql
SELECT column_list  
FROM table_name
```

- **column_list** includes one or more columns from which data is retrieved  
- **table-name** is the name of the table from which the information is retrieved  
  
**Below is the data from our customers table:**
