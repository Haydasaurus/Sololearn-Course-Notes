# Multiple Queries
SQL allows to run multiple queries or commands at the same time.  
  
The following SQL statement selects the **FirstName** and **City** columns from the customers table:

```sql
SELECT FirstName FROM customers;
SELECT City FROM customers;
```

**Result:**

>ğŸ›ˆ Remember to end each SQL statement with a **semicolon** to indicate that the statement is complete and ready to be interpreted.

>In this tutorial, we will use **semicolon** at the end of each SQL statement.

# Case Sensitivity
SQL is case **insensitive**.  

The following statements are equivalent and will produce the same result:

```sql
select City from customers;  
SELECT City FROM customers;  
sElEct City From customers;
```

>ğŸ›ˆ It is common practice to write all SQL commands in **upper-case**.

# Syntax Rules
A single SQL statement can be placed on one or more text lines. In addition, multiple SQL statements can be combined on a single text line.  
  
White spaces and multiple lines are ignored in SQL.  

For example, the following query is absolutely correct.

```sql
SELECT        City  
  
FROM customers;
```

However, it is recommended to avoid unnecessary white spaces and lines.

>ğŸ›ˆ Combined with proper spacing and indenting, breaking up the commands into logical lines will make your SQL statements much easier to read and maintain.
