# Fully Qualified Names
In SQL, you can provide the table name prior to the column name, by separating them with a **dot**.  

**The following statements are equivalent:**

```sql
SELECT city FROM customers;
SELECT customers.City FROM customers;
```

The term for the above-mentioned syntax is called the **"fully qualified name"** of that column.

>ğŸ›ˆ This form of writing is especially useful when working with multiple tables that may share the same column names.

# Order By  
**ORDER BY** is used with SELECT to **sort** the returned data.  
  
The following example sorts our **customers** table by the _FirstName_ column.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY FirstName
```

**Result:**

![[73je4snr.bmp]]

As you can see, the rows are ordered **alphabetically** by the **FirstName** column.

>ğŸ›ˆ By default, the ORDER BY keyword sorts the results in **ascending** order.

---

# Sorting Multiple Columns
ORDER BY can sort retrieved data by multiple columns. When using ORDER BY with more than one column, separate the list of columns to follow ORDER BY with **commas**.  

Here is the **customers** table, showing the following records:

![[gkjgf6ph.bmp]]

To order by **LastName** and **Age**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY LastName, Age;
```

This ORDER BY statement returns the following result:

![[1v58rx8f.bmp]]

As we have two **Smith**s, they will be ordered by the **Age** column in ascending order.

>ğŸ›ˆ The ORDER BY command starts ordering in the same sequence as the columns. It will order by the first column listed, then by the second, and so on.
