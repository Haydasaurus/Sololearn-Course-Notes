# Selecting Multiple Columns
As previously mentioned, the SQL SELECT statement retrieves records from tables in your SQL database.  
  
You can select multiple table columns at once.  

Just list the column names, separated by **commas**

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City
FROM customers;
```

**Result:**

![[ndfjinol.bmp]]

>ğŸ›ˆ Do not put a comma after the **last** column name.

---

# Selecting All Columns
To retrieve all of the information contained in your table, place an **asterisk (*)** sign after the SELECT command, rather than typing in each column names separately.  
  
The following SQL statement selects all of the columns in the **customers** table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

**Result:**

![[op67jwwi.bmp]]

>ğŸ›ˆ In SQL, the asterisk means **all**.
