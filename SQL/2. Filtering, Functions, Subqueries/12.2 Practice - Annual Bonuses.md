The salary shown in the table is **monthly**.  

Each employee receives a bonus once a year. The bonus for each employee is equal to their years of experience **multiplied by 500**.  
  
Write a query to output the **firstname** and **lastname** columns into one column named **fullname** separated by space, and the total annual salary for each employee keeping in mind bonuses named '**total'.** Sort by the **'total'** column.

>🛈 Use the **AS** keyword and the **CONCAT** function!

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(firstname, ' ', lastname) AS fullname, 
salary*12+experience*500 AS total 
FROM staff 
ORDER BY total;
```
