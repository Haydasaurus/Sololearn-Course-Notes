# Subqueries
A **subquery** is a query within another query.  
  
Let's consider an example. We might need the list of all employees whose salaries are greater than the average.  

**First, calculate the average:**

```sql
SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM employees;
```

As we already know the average, we can use a simple WHERE to list the salaries that are **greater** than that number.

```sql
SELECT FirstName, Salary FROM employees
WHERE Salary > 3100
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

**Result:**

>ðŸ›ˆ The **DESC** keyword sorts results in **descending** order.  
>
>Similarly, **ASC** sorts the results in **ascending** order.

# Subqueries
A single subquery will return the same result more easily.

```sql
SELECT FirstName, Salary FROM employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM employees)
ORDER BY Salary DECS;
```

The same result will be produced.

>Also, note that there is no semicolon at the end of the subquery, as it is part of our single query.
