# The IN Operator
The **IN** operator is used when you want to compare a column with more than one value.  
  
For example, you might need to select all customers from New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

With the **OR** condition, your SQL would look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE City = 'New York'
OR City =  'Lost Angeles'
OR City = 'Chicago';
```

**Result:**

![[nkxsjavz.bmp]]

# The IN Operator
You can achieve the same result with a single IN condition, instead of the multiple **OR** conditions:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE City IN ('New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago');
```

**This would also produce the same result:**

![[nkxsjavz.bmp]]

>ðŸ›ˆ Note the use of **parentheses** in the syntax.

# The NOT IN Operator
The **NOT IN** operator allows you to exclude a list of specific values from the result set.  
  
If we add the **NOT** keyword before **IN** in our previous query, customers living in those cities will be excluded:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE City NOT IN ('New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago');
```

**Result:**

![[tz29z6nv.bmp]]
