# The UPPER Function
The **UPPER** function converts all letters in the specified string to uppercase.  

The **LOWER** function converts the string to lowercase.  
  
**The following SQL query selects all _LastNames_ as uppercase:**

```sql
SELECT FirstName, UPPER(LastName) AS LastName
FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

![[b1nt2cxe.bmp]]

>ğŸ›ˆ If there are characters in the string that are not letters, this function will have no effect on them.

# SQRT and AVG
The **SQRT** function returns the square root of given value in the argument.  
  
**Let's calculate the square root of each Salary:**

```sql
SELECT Salary, SQRT(Salary)
FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

![[mgz3dcaj.bmp]]

Similarly, the **AVG** function returns the average value of a numeric column:

```sql
SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

![[4y2lzhtx.bmp]]

>ğŸ›ˆ Another way to do the SQRT is to use POWER with the 1/2 exponent. However, SQRT seems to work faster than POWER in this case.

# The SUM function
The **SUM** function is used to calculate the sum for a column's values.  
  
For example, to get the sum of all of the salaries in the employees table, our SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT SUM(Salary) FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

![[zspnonn6.bmp]]

>ğŸ›ˆ The sum of all of the employees' salaries is 31000.
