# The Like Operator
The **LIKE** keyword is useful when specifying a **search condition** within your WHERE clause.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)  
FROM table_name  
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
```

SQL **pattern** matching enables you to use "_" to match any single character and "%" to match an arbitrary number of characters (including zero characters).
  
For example, to select employees whose _FirstNames_ begin with the letter **A**, you would use the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'A%';
```

**Result:**

As another example, the following SQL query selects all employees with a _LastName_ ending with the letter "s":

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE FirstName LIKE '%s';
```

**Result:**

>ğŸ›ˆ The % wildcard can be used **multiple** times within the same pattern.

# The MIN Function
The **MIN** function is used to return the minimum value of an expression in a SELECT statement.  
  
For example, you might wish to know the minimum salary among the employees.

```sql
SELECT MIN(Salary) AS Salary FROM employees;
```
