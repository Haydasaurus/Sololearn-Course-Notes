# The CONCAT Function
The **CONCAT** function is used to concatenate two or more text values and returns the concatenating string.  
  
**Let's concatenate the _FirstName_ with the _City_, separating them with a _comma_:**

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ', ', City) FROM customers;
```

**The output result is:**

# The AS Keyword
A concatenation results in a new column. The default column name will be the CONCAT function.  

You can assign a custom name to the resulting column using the **AS** keyword:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ', ', City) AS new_column
FROM customers;
```

And when you run the query, the column name appears to be changed.
