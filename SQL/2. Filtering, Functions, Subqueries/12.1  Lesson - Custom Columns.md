# The CONCAT Function
The **CONCAT** function is used to concatenate two or more text values and returns the concatenating string.  
  
**Let's concatenate the _FirstName_ with the _City_, separating them with a _comma_:**

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ', ', City) FROM customers;
```

**The output result is:**

>ğŸ›ˆ The CONCAT() function takes two or more parameters.

# The AS Keyword
A concatenation results in a new column. The default column name will be the CONCAT function.  

You can assign a custom name to the resulting column using the **AS** keyword:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ', ', City) AS new_column
FROM customers;
```

And when you run the query, the column name appears to be changed.

# Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform arithmetical operations on numeric operands. The Arithmetic operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/).  
  
The following **employees** table shows employee names and salaries:

The example below adds 500 to each employee's salary and selects the result:

```sql
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, Salary+500 AS Salary
FROM employees;
```

**Result**:
