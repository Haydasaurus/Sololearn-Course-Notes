# The WHERE Statement
The **WHERE** clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified criterion.  

**The syntax for the WHERE clause:**

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM tabel_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Consider the following table:**

![[r3dyxuyh.bmp]]

**In the above table, to SELECT a specific record:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE ID = 7;
```

![[y1y8fta2.bmp]]

>ðŸ›ˆ The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified criterion.

# SQL Operators
**Comparison Operators** and **Logical Operators** are used in the WHERE clause to filter the data to be selected.  
  
The following comparison operators can be used in the WHERE clause:

![[2bzqeeg2.bmp]]

For example, we can display all customers names listed in our table, with the exception of the one with ID 5.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE ID != 5;
```

**Result:**

![[o7ccia2a.bmp]]

As you can see, the record with ID=5 is excluded from the list.

>ðŸ›ˆ As you can see, the record with ID=5 is excluded from the list.

# The BETWEEN Operator  
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a range. The first value must be lower bound and the second value, the upper bound.  
  
**The syntax for the BETWEEN clause is as follows:**

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)  
FROM table_name  
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

The following SQL statement selects all records with IDs that fall between 3 and 7:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE ID BETWEEN 3 AND 7;
```

**Result**:

![[hyprakm0.bmp]]

>ðŸ›ˆ As you can see, the lower bound and upper bound are both included in the range.

# Text Values  
When working with text columns, surround any text that appears in the statement with **single quotation marks (')**.  
  
The following SQL statement selects all records in which the _City_ is equal to 'New York'.

```sql
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, City
FROM customers
WHERE City = 'New York';
```

![[h80tmgad.bmp]]

>ðŸ›ˆ If your text contains an apostrophe (single quote), you should use two single quote characters to escape the apostrophe. For example: 'Can''t'.
