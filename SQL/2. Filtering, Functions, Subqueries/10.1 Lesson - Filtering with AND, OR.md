# Logical Operators
Logical operators can be used to combine two Boolean values and return a result of **true**, **false**, or **null**.  

**The following operators can be used:**

When retrieving data using a SELECT statement, use logical operators in the WHERE clause to combine multiple conditions.  
  
If you want to select rows that satisfy all of the given conditions, use the logical operator, **AND**.

To find the names of the customers between 30 to 40 years of age, set up the query as seen here:

```sql
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, Age
FROM customers
WHERE Age >= 30 AND Age <= 40;
```

**This results in the following output:**

>ğŸ›ˆ You can combine as many conditions as needed to return the desired results.

# OR  
If you want to select rows that satisfy at least one of the given conditions, you can use the logical **OR** operator.  
  
**The following table describes how the logical OR operator functions:**

For example, if you want to find the customers who live either in New York or Chicago, the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE City = 'New York' OR City = 'Chicago';
```

**Result:**

>ğŸ›ˆ You can OR two or more conditions.

# Combining AND & OR  
The SQL **AND** and **OR** conditions may be combined to test multiple conditions in a query.  
These two operators are called **conjunctive operators**.  
  
When combining these conditions, it is important to use **parentheses**, so that the order to evaluate each condition is known.  
  
**Consider the following table:**

![[k2l75our.bmp]]

The statement below selects all customers from the city "New York" **AND** with the age equal to "30" **OR** â€œ35":

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE City = 'New York'
AND (Age=20 OR Age=35);
```

**Result:**

>ğŸ›ˆ You can nest as many conditions as you need.
