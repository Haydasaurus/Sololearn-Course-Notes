# The switch Statement
A **switch** statement tests a variable for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a **case**, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.  
**Syntax:**

```java
switch (expression) {  
	case value1 :  
		//Statements  
		break; //optional  
	case value2 :  
		//Statements  
		break; //optional  
	//You can have any number of case statements.  
	default : //Optional  
		//Statements  
}
```

- When the variable being switched on is equal to a **case**, the statements following that **case** will execute until a **break** statement is reached.  
- When a **break** statement is reached, the **switch** terminates, and the flow of control jumps to the next line after the **switch** statement.  
- Not every **case** needs to contain a **break**. If no **break** appears, the flow of control will fall through to subsequent cases until a **break** is reached.  
  
The example below tests **day** against a set of values and prints a corresponding message.

```java
int day = 3;

switch(day) {
	case 1:
		System.out.println("Monday");
		break;
	case 2:
		System.out.println("Tuesday");
		break;
	case 3:
		System.out.println("Wednesday");
		break;
}
```

>ğŸ›ˆ You can have any number of **case** statements within a **switch**. Each **case** is followed by the comparison value and a colon.

# The default Statement
A switch statement can have an optional **default** case.  
The **default** case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is matched.  
  
**For example:**

```java
int day = 3;

switch(day) {
	case 6:
		System.out.println("Saturday");
		break;
	case 7:
		System.out.println("Sunday");
		break;
	default:
		System.out.println("Wednesday");
}
```

>ğŸ›ˆ No **break** is needed in the default case, as it is always the last statement in the switch.

---

# The switch Expression
The **switch expression** allows multiple comma-separated values per case and returns a value for the whole switch-case block.  
  
**For example:**

```java
String dayType = switch(day) {
	case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> "Working Day";
	case 6, 7 -> "Weekend";
	default -> "Invalid day";
	};
```

The switch expression makes the switch-case block much shorter and doesn't use a break statement.  

>ğŸ›ˆ Notice the **-> shorthand** after the cases.
