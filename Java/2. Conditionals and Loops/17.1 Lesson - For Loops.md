# for Loops
Another loop structure is the **for** loop. A for loop allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times.  
**Syntax:**

```java
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {  
	statement(s)  
}
```

**Initialization**: Expression executes only once during the beginning of loop  
**Condition**: Is evaluated each time the loop iterates. The loop executes the statement repeatedly, until this condition returns false.  
**Increment/Decrement**: Executes after each iteration of the loop.  

```java
for(int x = 1; x <= 5; x++) {
	System.out.println(x);
}
```

The following example prints the numbers 1 through 5.This initializes x to the value 1, and repeatedly prints the value of x, until the condition x<=5 becomes false. On each iteration, the statement x++ is executed, incrementing x by one.

>ðŸ›ˆ Notice the semicolon (;) after initialization and condition in the syntax.

# for Loops
You can have any type of condition and any type of increment statements in the for loop.  
The example below prints only the even values between 0 and 10:

```java
for(int x=0; x<=10; x=x+2) {
	System.out.println(x);
}
/*
0
2
4
6
8
10
*/
```

>ðŸ›ˆ A **for** loop is best when the starting and ending numbers are known.
