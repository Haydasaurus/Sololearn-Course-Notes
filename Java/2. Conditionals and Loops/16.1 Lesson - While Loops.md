# while Loops
A **loop** statement allows to repeatedly execute a statement or group of statements.  
  
A **while** loop statement repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.  
  
**Example:**

```java
int x = 3

while(x > 0) {
	System.out.println(x);
	x--;
}
```

The **while** loops check for the condition x > 0. If it evaluates to true, it executes the statements within its body. Then it checks for the statement again and repeats.

>ðŸ›ˆ Notice the statement x--. This decrements x each time the loop runs, and makes the loop stop when x reaches 0.  
Without the statement, the loop would run forever.

---

# while Loops
When the expression is tested and the result is false, the loop body is skipped and the first statement after the while loop is executed.  
**Example:**

```java
int x = 6;

while( x < 10 )
{
	System.out.println(x);
	x++;
}
System.out.println("Loop ended");

/*
6
7
8
9
Loop ended
*/
```

>ðŸ›ˆ Notice that the last print method is out of the while scope.
