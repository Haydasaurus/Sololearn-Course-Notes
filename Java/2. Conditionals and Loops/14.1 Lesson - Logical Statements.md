# Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.  
  
Let's say you wanted your program to output "Welcome!" only when the variable **age** is greater than 18 and the variable **money** is greater than 500.  
One way to accomplish this is to use nested **if** statements:

```java
if (age > 18) {
	if (money > 500) {
		System.out.println("Welcome!");
	}
}
```

However, using the **AND** logical operator (**&&**) is a better way:

```java
if (age > 18 && money > 500){
	System.out.println("Welcome!");
}
```

>ğŸ›ˆ If both operands of the AND operator are true, then the condition becomes true.

---

# The OR Operator
The **OR** operator (||) checks if any one of the conditions is true.  
The condition becomes true, if any one of the operands evaluates to true.  
**For example:**

```java
int age = 25;
int money = 100;

if (age > 18 || money > 500) {
	System.out.println("Welcome!");
}
```

The code above will print "Welcome!" if age is greater than 18 **or** if money is greater than 500.  
  
The **NOT** **!**) logical operator is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, the **NOT** logical operator will make it false.  
**Example:**

```java
int age = 25;
if (!(age > 18)) {
	System.out.println("Too Young");
} else {
	System.out.println("Welcome!")
}
```

>ğŸ›ˆ !(age > 18) reads as "if age is NOT greater than 18".
