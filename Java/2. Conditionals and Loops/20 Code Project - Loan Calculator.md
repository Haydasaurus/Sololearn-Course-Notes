# Loan Calculator
You take a loan from a friend and need to calculate how much you will owe him after 3 months.  
You are going to pay him back 10% of the remaining loan amount each month.  
Create a program that takes the loan amount as input, calculates and outputs the remaining amount after 3 months.  
  
**Sample Input:**  
20000  
  
**Sample Output:**  
10628  
  
Here is the monthly payment schedule:  
**Month 1**  
Payment: 10% of 20000 = 2000  
Remaining amount: 18000  
**Month 2**  
Payment: 10% of 18000 = 1800  
Remaining amount: 16200  
**Month 3:**  
Payment: 10% of 16200 = 1620  
Remaining amount: **14580**

>ðŸ›ˆ Use a loop to calculate the payment and remaining amounts for each month.  
>
>Also, use **integers** for amounts.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Program
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int amount = scanner.nextInt();
		
		//your code goes here
		int rem_amt = amount;
		for (int i = 1 ; i <= 6 ; i++) {
	int paid = (int)Math.ceil(rem_amt);
	rem_amt = paid ;
	}
System.out.println(rem_amt*729/1000);
	}
}
```
