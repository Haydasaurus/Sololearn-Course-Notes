# do...while Loops
A **do...while** loop is similar to a **while** loop, except that a **do...while** loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.  
**Example:**

```java
int x = 1;
do {
	System.out.println(x);
	x++;
} while(x < 5);

/*
1
2
3
4
*/
```

Notice that the condition appears at the end of the loop, so the statements in the loop execute once before it is tested.  
Even with a false condition, the code will run once.  
**Example:**

```java
int x = 1;
do {
	System.out.println(x);
	X++;
} while(x<0);
```

>ðŸ›ˆ Notice that in doâ€¦while loops, the while is just the condition and doesn't have a body itself.

# Loop Control Statements
The **break** and **continue** statements change the loop's execution flow.  
The **break** statement terminates the loop and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.  
**Example:**

```java
int x = 1;

while(x > 0) {
	System.out.println(x);
		if(x == 4) {
			break;
		}
		x++;
}
```

The **continue** statement causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and then immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating. In other words, it makes the loop skip to its next iteration.  
**Example:**

```java
for(int x=10; x<=40; x=x+10) {
	if(x == 30) {
		continue;
	}
	System.out.println(x);
}
```

>ðŸ›ˆ As you can see, the above code skips the value of 30, as directed by the **continue** statement.
