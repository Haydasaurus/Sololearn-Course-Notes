# else if Statements
Instead of using nested **if-else** statements, you can use the **else if** statement to check multiple conditions.  
**For example:** 

```java
int age = 25;

if(age <= 0) {
	System.out.println("Error");
} else if(age <= 16) {
	System.out.println("Too Young");
} else if(age < 100) {
	System.out.println("Welcome!");
} else {
	System.out.println("Really?");
}
```

The code will check the condition to evaluate to true and execute the statements inside that block.

>ðŸ›ˆ You can include as many **else if** statements as you need.
