# Decision Making
**Conditional statements** are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.  
The **if statement** is one of the most frequently used conditional statements.  
If the **if** statement's condition expression evaluates to true, the block of code inside the **if** statement is executed. If the expression is found to be false, the first set of code after the end of the **if** statement (after the closing curly brace) is executed.  
**Syntax:**

```java
if (condition) {  
//Executes when the condition is true  
}
```

Any of the following comparison operators may be used to form the condition:  
**<** less than  
**>** greater than  
**!=** not equal to  
== equal to  
**<=** less than or equal to  
**>=** greater than or equal to  
  
**For example:**

```java
int x = 7;
if(x < 42) {
	System.out.println("Hi");
}
```

>ðŸ›ˆ Remember that you need to use two equal signs ( == ) to test for equality, since a single equal sign is the assignment operator.

# if...else Statements
An **if** statement can be followed by an optional **else** statement, which executes when the condition evaluates to false.  
**For example:**

```java
int age = 36;

if (age < 16) {
	System.out.println("Too Young");
} else {
	System.out.println("Welcome!")
}
```

>ðŸ›ˆ As age equals 30, the condition in the **if** statement evaluates to false and the **else** statement is executed.
