# Threads
Java is a **multi-threaded** programming language. This means that our program can make optimal use of available resources by running two or more components concurrently, with each component handling a different task.  
You can subdivide specific operations within a single application into individual **threads** that all run in parallel.  
The following diagram shows the life-cycle of a thread.

There are two ways to create a thread.  
**1. Extend the Thread class**  
Inherit from the **Thread** class, override its **run**() method, and write the functionality of the thread in the **run**() method.  
Then you create a new object of your class and call it's **start** method to run the thread.  
**Example:**

```java
class Loader extends Thread {
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}
}

class MyClass {
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		Loader obj = new Loader();
		obj.start();
	}
}
```

As you can see, our Loader class extends the Thread class and overrides its **run()** method.  
When we create the **obj** object and call its **start**() method, the **run**() method statements execute on a different thread.

>ðŸ›ˆ Every Java thread is prioritized to help the operating system determine the order in which to schedule threads. The priorities range from 1 to 10, with each thread defaulting to priority 5. You can set the thread priority with the **setPriority**() method.

# Threads
The other way of creating Threads is **implementing the Runnable interface**.  
Implement **the** run() method. Then, create a new Thread object, pass the Runnable class to its constructor, and start the Thread by calling the **start**() method.  
**Example:**

```java
class Loader implements Runnable {
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}
}

class MyClass {
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		Thread t = new Thread(new Loader());
		t.start();
	}
}
```

The **Thread.sleep()** method pauses a Thread for a specified period of time. For example, calling **Thread.sleep(1000);** pauses the thread for one second. Keep in mind that **Thread.sleep(**) throws an InterruptedException, so be sure to surround it with a **try/catch** block.

>ðŸ›ˆ It may seem that implementing the Runnable interface is a bit more complex than extending from the Thread class. However, implementing the Runnable interface is the preferred way to start a Thread, because it enables you to extend from another class, as well.
