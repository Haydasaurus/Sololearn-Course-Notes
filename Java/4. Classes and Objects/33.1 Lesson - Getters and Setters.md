# Getters & Setters
**Getters** and **Setters** are used to effectively protect your data, particularly when creating classes. For each variable, the **get** method returns its value, while the **set** method sets the value.  
  
**Getters** start with **get**, followed by the variable name, with the first letter of the variable name capitalized.  
**Setters** start with **set**, followed by the variable name, with the first letter of the variable name capitalized.  
  
**Example:**

```java
public class Vehicle {  
	private String color;  
  
	// Getter  
	public String getColor() {  
	return color;  
	}  
  
	// Setter  
	public void setColor(String c) {  
		this.color = c;  
	}  
}
```

The **getter** method returns the value of the attribute.  
The **setter** method takes a parameter and assigns it to the attribute.

>ðŸ›ˆ The keyword **this** is used to refer to the current object. Basically, **this.color** is the **color** attribute of the current object.

# Getters & Setters
Once our getter and setter have been defined, we can use it in our **main**

```java
public static void main(String[ ] args) {
	Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();
	v1.setColor("Red");
	System.out.println(v1.getColor());
}
```

Getters and setters allow us to have control over the values. You may, for example, validate the given value in the setter before actually setting the value.

>ðŸ›ˆ Getters and setters are fundamental building blocks for **encapsulation**, which will be covered in the next module.
