# final
Use the **final** keyword to mark a variable constant, so that it can be assigned only once.  
**Example:**

```java
class MyClass {
	public static final double PI = 3.14;
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		System.out.println(PI);
	}
}
```

**PI** is now a constant. Any attempt to assign it a value will cause an error.

>ðŸ›ˆ Methods and classes can also be marked **final**. This serves to restrict methods so that they can't be overridden and classes so that they can't be subclassed.  
These concepts will be covered in the next module.
