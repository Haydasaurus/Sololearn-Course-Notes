# Creating Classes
In order to create your own custom objects, you must first create the corresponding classes. This is accomplished by right clicking on the **src** folder in Eclipse and selecting Create->New->Class. Give your class a name and click **Finish** to add the new class to your project: ![contentImage](https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2866)As you can see, Eclipse has already added the initial code for the class.  
Now lets create a simple method in our new class.  
**Animal.java**

```java
public class Animal {  
	void bark() {  
		System.out.println("Woof-Woof");  
	}  
}
```

We declared a **bark()** method in our **Animal** class.

>ğŸ›ˆ Now, in order to use the class and it's methods, we need to declare an **object** of that class.

---

# Creating Objects  
Let's head over to our **main** and create a new object of our class.  
**MyClass.java**

```java
class MyCalss {
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		Animal dog = new Animal();
		dog.bark();
	}
}
```

Now, **dog** is an object of type **Animal**. Thus we can call its **bark**() method, using the name of the object and a **dot**.  
The **dot** notation is used to access the object's **attributes** and **methods**.

>ğŸ›ˆ You have just created your first object!
