# Defining Attributes
A class has **attributes** and **methods**. The attributes are basically variables within a class.  
Let's create a class called **Vehicle**, with its corresponding attributes and methods.

```java
public class Vehicle {  
	int maxSpeed;  
	int wheels;  
	String color;  
	double fuelCapacity;  
  
	void horn() {  
		System.out.println("Beep!");  
	}  
}
```

**maxSpeed**, **wheels**, **color** and **fuelCapacity** are the attributes of our Vehicle class, and **horn()** is the only method.

>ğŸ›ˆ You can define as many attributes and methods as necessary.

---

# Creating Objects
Next, we can create multiple objects of our **Vehicle** class, and use the dot syntax to access their attributes and methods.

```java
class MyClass {
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();
		Vehicle v2 = new Vehicle();
		v1.color = "red";
		v2.horn();
	}
}
```
