# Static
When you declare a variable or a method as **static**, it belongs to the class, rather than to a specific instance. This means that only one instance of a **static** member exists, even if you create multiple objects of the class, or if you don't create any. It will be shared by all objects.  
**Example:**

```java
public class Counter {  
	public **static** int COUNT=0;  
	Counter() {  
		COUNT++;  
	}  
}
```

The **COUNT** variable will be shared by all objects of that class.  
Now, we can create objects of our Counter class in **main**, and access the static variable.

```java
public class MyClass {
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		Counter c1 = new Counter();
		Counter c2 = new Counter();
		System.out.println(Counter.COUNT)
	}
}
```

The output is 2, because the **COUNT** variable is static and gets incremented by one each time a new object of the Counter class is created. In the code above, we created 2 objects.  
You can also access the static variable using any object of that class, such as **c1.COUNT**.

>ğŸ›ˆ Itâ€™s a common practice to use upper case when naming a static variable, although not mandatory.

# Static
The same concept applies to **static** methods.

```java
public class Vehicle {  
	public static void horn() {  
		System.out.println("Beep");  
	}  
}
```

Now, the **horn** method can be called without creating an object:

```java
public class MyClass {
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		Vehicle.horn();
	}
}
```

Another example of static methods are those of the **Math** class, which is why you can call them without creating a **Math** object.

>ğŸ›ˆ Also, the **main** method must always be **static**.
