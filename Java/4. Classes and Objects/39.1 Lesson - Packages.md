# Packages
**Packages** are used to avoid name conflicts and to control access to classes.  
A **package** can be defined as a group made up of similar types of classes, along with sub-packages.  
Creating a package in Java is quite easy. Simply right click on your **src** directory and click New->Package. Give your package a name and click **Finish**.  
You will notice that the new package appears in the project directory. Now you can move and create classes inside that package. We have moved our **Vehicle**, **Counter** and **Animal** classes to the package **samples**.

When you move/create a class in your package, the following code will appear at the top of the list of files.

```java
package samples;
```

This indicates the package to which the class belongs.  
Now, we need to import the classes that are inside a package in our main to be able to use them.  
The following example shows how to use the **Vehicle** class of the **samples** package.

```java
import samples.Vehicle;  
  
class MyClass {  
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {  
		Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();  
		v1.horn();  
	}  
}
```

Two major results occur when a class is placed in a package. First, the name of the package becomes a part of the name of the class. Second, the name of the package must match the directory structure where the corresponding class file resides.

>ðŸ›ˆ Use a wildcard to import all classes in a package.  
For example, **import samples.*** will import all classes in the samples package.
