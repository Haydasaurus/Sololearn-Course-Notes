# The Return Type  
The **return** keyword can be used in methods to return a value.  
For example, we could define a method named **sum** that returns the sum of its two parameters.

```java
static int sum(int val1, int val2) {  
return val1 + val2;  
}
```

Notice that in the method definition, we defined the **return type** before we defined the method name. For our sum method, it is **int**, as it takes two parameters of the type **int** and returns their sum, which is also an **int**.

>ğŸ›ˆ The **static** keyword will be discussed in a future lesson.

```java
class MyClass {
static in sum(int val1, int val2) {
	return val1 + val2;
}

	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		int x = sum(2, 5);
		System.out.println(x);
	}
}
```

As the method returns a value, we can assign it to a variable.

>ğŸ›ˆ When you do not need to return any value from your method, use the keyword **void**.  
Notice the **void** keyword in the definition of the main method - this means that main does not return anything.

# The Return Type
Take a look at the same code from our previous lesson with explaining comments, so you can better understand how it works:

```java
// returns an int value 5 
static int returnFive() {  
return 5;  
}  
  
// has a parameter
static void sayHelloTo(String name) {  
System.out.println("Hello " + name);  
}  
  
// simply prints"Hello World!"
static void sayHello() {  
System.out.println("Hello World!");  
}
```

Having gained knowledge of method return types and parameters, let's take another look at the definition of the main method.

```java
public static void main(String[ ] args)
```

>ğŸ›ˆ This definition indicates that the **main** method takes an array of Strings as its parameters, and does not return a value.

---

# The Return Type  
Let's create a method that takes two parameters of type **int** and returns the greater one, then call it in **main**:

```java
public static void main(String[ ] args){
	int res = max(7, 42);
	System.out.println(res); //42
}

static int max(int a, int b) {
	if(a > b) {
		return a;
	}
	else{
		return b
	}
}
```

>ğŸ›ˆ A method can have one type of parameter (or parameters) and return another, different type. For example, it can take two doubles and return an int.
