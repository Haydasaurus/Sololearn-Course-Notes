# Array Length
You can access the length of an array (the number of elements it stores) via its **length** property.  
**Example:**

```java
int[ ] intArr = new int[5];
System.out.println(intArr.length);
```

>ðŸ›ˆ Don't forget that in arrays, indexes start from 0. So, in the example above, the last index is 4.

# Arrays  
Now that we know how to set and get array elements, we can calculate the sum of all elements in an array by using loops.  
The **for** loop is the most used loop when working with arrays, as we can use the **length** of the array to determine how many times to run the loop.

```java
int [ ] myArr = {6, 42, 3, 7};
int sum=0;
for(int x=0; x<myArr.length; x++) {
	sum += myArr[x];
}
System.out.println(sum);

//58
```

In the code above, we declared a variable **sum** to store the result and assigned it 0.  
Then we used a **for** loop to iterate through the array, and added each element's value to the variable.

>ðŸ›ˆ The condition of the **for** loop is x<myArr.length, as the last element's index is **myArr.length-1**.
