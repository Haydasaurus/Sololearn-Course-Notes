# Enhanced for Loop
The **enhanced for loop** (sometimes called a "for each" loop) is used to traverse elements in arrays.  
The advantages are that it eliminates the possibility of bugs and makes the code easier to read.  
**Example:**

```java
int [ ] primes = {2, 3, 5, 7};

for (int t: primes) {
	System.out.println(t);
}

/*
2
3
5
7
*/
```

The **enhanced for loop** declares a variable of a type compatible with the elements of the array being accessed. The variable will be available within the **for** block, and its value will be the same as the current array element.  
So, on each iteration of the loop, the variable **t** will be equal to the corresponding element in the array.

>ğŸ›ˆ Notice the **colon** after the variable in the syntax.
