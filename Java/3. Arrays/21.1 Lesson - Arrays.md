# Arrays
An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type.  
When you need to store a list of values, such as numbers, you can store them in an array, instead of declaring separate variables for each number.  
  
To declare an array, you need to define the type of the elements with **square brackets**.  
**For example, to declare an array of integers:**

```java
int[ ] arr;
```

The name of the array is **arr**. The type of elements it will hold is **int**.  
  
Now, you need to define the array's capacity, or the number of elements it will hold. To accomplish this, use the keyword **new**

```java
int[ ] arr = new int[5];
```

The code above declares an array of 5 integers.  
In an array, the elements are ordered and each has a specific and constant position, which is called an **index**.  
  
To reference elements in an array, type the name of the array followed by the index position within a pair of square brackets.  
**Example:**

```java
arr[2] = 42;
```

This assigns a value of 42 to the element with 2 as its index.

>ğŸ›ˆ Note that elements in the array are identified with **zero-based** index numbers, meaning that the first element's index is 0 rather than one. So, the maximum index of the array int[5] is 4.

# Initializing Arrays  
Java provides a shortcut for instantiating arrays of primitive types and strings.  
If you already know what values to insert into the array, you can use an **array literal**.  
**Example of an array literal:**

```java
String [ ] myNames = { "A", "B", "C", "D"};
System.out.println(myNames[2]);
```

Place the values in a **comma-separated** list, enclosed in curly braces.  
The code above automatically initializes an array containing 4 elements, and stores the provided values.

>ğŸ›ˆ Sometimes you might see the square brackets placed after the array name, which also works, but the preferred way is to place the brackets after the array's data type.
