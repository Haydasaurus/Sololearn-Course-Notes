# The Math Operators  
Java provides a rich set of operators to use in manipulating variables. A value used on either side of an operator is called an **operand**.  
For example, in the expression below, the numbers 6 and 3 are operands of the plus operator:

```java
int x = 6 + 3;
```

Java arithmetic operators:  
+ **addition**  
- **subtraction**  
* **multiplication**  
/ **division**  
% **modulo**

>ğŸ›ˆ Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebraic equations.

# Addition  
The + operator adds together two values, such as two constants, a constant and a variable, or a variable and a variable. Here are a few examples of addition:

```java
int sum1 = 50 + 10;  
int sum2 = sum1 + 66;  
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;
```

# Substraction  
The - operator subtracts one value from another.

```java
int sum1 = 1000 - 10;  
int sum2 = sum1 - 5;  
int sum3 = sum1 - sum2;

```

>ğŸ›ˆ Just like in algebra, you can use both of the operations in a single line. For example: int val = 10 + 5 - 2;

# Multiplication 
The * operator multiplies two values.

```java
int sum1 = 1000 * 2;  
int sum2 = sum1 * 10;  
int sum3 = sum1 * sum2;
```

# Division
The / operator divides one value by another.

```java
int sum1 = 1000 / 5;  
int sum2 = sum1 / 2;  
int sum3 = sum1 / sum2;
```

>ğŸ›ˆ In the example above, the result of the division equation will be a whole number, as **int** is used as the data type. You can use **double** to retrieve a value with a decimal point.

---

# Modulo
The **modulo** (or remainder) math operation performs an integer division of one value by another, and returns the remainder of that division.  
The operator for the modulo operation is the percentage (%) character.  
**Example:**

```java
int value = 23
int res = value % 6; // res is 5
```

>ğŸ›ˆ Dividing 23 by 6 returns a quotient of 3, with a remainder of 5. Thus, the value of 5 is assigned to the **res** variable.
