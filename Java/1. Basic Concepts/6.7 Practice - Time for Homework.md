# Primitive Operators
Students are given homework in math, history, and geometry.  
Write a program that takes the time spent on each subject as input, and calculates and outputs the total number of **hours** and **minutes** spent on each subject, each on a new line accordingly.  
  
**Sample Input**  
35  
40  
39  
  
**Sample Output**  
1  
54  
  
**Explanation**  
The total amount of spent minutes is 114, which is equal to 1 hour (the first output) and 54 minutes (the second output).

>ğŸ›ˆ Use int type for the variables representing hours and minutes.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int math = scanner.nextInt();
		int history = scanner.nextInt();
		int geometry = scanner.nextInt();

		//your code goes here
		int sum = math + history +geometry;
		int hours = sum / 60;
		int minutes = sum % 60;
		System.out.println(hours);
		System.out.println(minutes);
	}
}
```
