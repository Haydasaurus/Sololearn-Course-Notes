# Java Comments  
A programmer wrote a program to print odd numbers. He wanted to explain how the program works in the code, but he forgot to comment and the program does not work. Comment lines so that it prints the odd numbers.  

>ğŸ›ˆ If you have to comment many lines, it's easier to just use multiline comments.

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		/*So the program prints some odd
		numbers and it works perfectly*/
			System.out.println("1");
			System.out.println("3");
			System.out.println("7");
	}
}
```
