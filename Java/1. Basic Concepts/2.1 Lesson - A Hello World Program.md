# Your First Java Program  
Let's start by creating a simple program that prints “Hello World” to the screen. 

```java
class MyClass {
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
```

In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a **class**.  
In our example, we named the class **MyClass**. You will learn more about classes in the upcoming modules.  

In Java, each application has an entry point, or a starting point, which is a method called **main**. Along with main, the keywords **public** and **static** will also be explained later.

>🛈 As a summary:  
>- Every program in Java must have a **class**.  
>- Every Java program starts from the **main** method.

---

# The main Method  
To run our program, the **main** method must be identical to this signature:

```java
public static void main(String[ ] args)
```

- **public**: anyone can access it  
- **static**: method can be run without creating an instance of the class containing the main method  
- **void**: method doesn't return any value  
- **main**: the name of the method  
  
For example, the following code declares a method called **test**, which does not return anything and has no parameters:

```java
void test()
```

>🛈 The method's parameters are declared inside the parentheses that follow the name of the method.  
>
>For **main**, it's an array of strings called **args**. We will use it in our next lesson, so don't worry if you don't understand it all now.

---

# System.out.println() 
Next is the body of the **main** method, enclosed in curly braces:

```java
{  
System.out.println("Hello World!");  
}
```

The **println** method prints a line of text to the screen.  
The **System** class and its **out** stream are used to access the **println** method.

>🛈 In classes, methods, and other flow-control structures code is always enclosed in curly braces { }.

---

You can pass a different text as the parameter to the **println** method to print it.

```java
class MyClass {
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		System.out.println("I am learning Java");
	}
}
```

In Java, each code statement must end with a **semicolon**.

>🛈 Remember: do not use **semicolons** after method and class declarations that follow with the body defined using the curly braces.
