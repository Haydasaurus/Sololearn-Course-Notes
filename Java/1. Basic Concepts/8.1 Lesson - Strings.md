# Strings
A **String** is an object that represents a sequence of characters.  
For example, "Hello" is a string of 5 characters.  
  
**For example:**

```java
String s = "SoloLearn";
```

>ğŸ›ˆ You are allowed to define an empty string. For example, String str = "";

# String Concatenation
The + (plus) operator between strings adds them together to make a new string. This process is called **concatenation**.  
The resulted string is the first string put together with the second string.  
**For example:**

```java
String firstName, lastName;
firstName = "David";
lastName = "Williams";

System.out.println("My Name is " + firstName + " " + lastName);
```

>ğŸ›ˆ The **char** data type represents a single character.
