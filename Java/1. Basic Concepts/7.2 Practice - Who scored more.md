# Increment & Decrement
Tom and Bob are playing a board game, in which both players start with the same number of points. Tom won the first game and got 1 point, while Bob lost the game, and therefore lost 1 point.  
  
You are given a program that is intended to take the initial score and increase Tom's score by 1 and decrease Bob's score by 1.  
But something is wrong: the program outputs the scores without the change.  
  
**Task**  
Fix the program to result in the expected outputs.  
  
**Sample Input**  
5  
  
**Sample Output**  
Round 1 results:  
6  
4  
  
**Explanation**  
Both players had 5 points at the start of the game. After the first game, Tom gained 1 point (6, the first outputted number), and Bob lost 1 point (4, the second outputted number).

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		//taking initial score
		int initScore = scanner.nextInt();
		int scoreTom = initScore;
		int scoreBob = initScore;

		System.out.println("Round 1 results:");
		//fix
		System.out.println(++scoreTom);
		System.out.println(--scoreBob);
	}

}
