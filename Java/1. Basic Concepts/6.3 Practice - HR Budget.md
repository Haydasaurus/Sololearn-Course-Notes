# Primitive Operators
You have two employees in your organization.  
Write a program to take their salaries as input and print them both out.  
  
**Sample Input**  
1500  
3200  
  
**Sample output**  
4700  

>ðŸ›ˆ You can create a new variable for the total amount of the salary.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		//get salaries
		int salary1 = scanner.nextInt();
		int salary2 = scanner.nextInt();
		
		//your code goes here
		int salaries = salary1 + salary2;
		System.out.println(salaries);
		
	}

}
```
