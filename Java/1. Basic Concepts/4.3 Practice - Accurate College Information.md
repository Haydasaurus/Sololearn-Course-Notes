# Variables
A college's data system stores information about its students, such as their names, ages, average scores, and whether they graduated or not. Variables representing these parameters are declared incorrectly in the system's code. Fix the errors so that the system can print the values.  
  
**Sample:**  
John  
21  
false  
4.3  

>ðŸ›ˆ There are several ways to name variables. In Java, itâ€™s a common practice to start variable names with a lower case. If a variable name includes multiple words the first word should be in lowercase and each following word should start with an upper case.

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//correct variable declarations
		String name = "John";
		int age = 21;
		boolean isGraduated = false;
		double averageScore = 4.3;
		//do not change this code
		System.out.println(name);
		System.out.println(age);
		System.out.println(isGraduated);
		System.out.println(averageScore);
	}
}
```
