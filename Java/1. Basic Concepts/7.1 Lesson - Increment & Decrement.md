# Increment Operators
An **increment** or **decrement** operator provides a more convenient and compact way to increase or decrease the value of a variable by **one**.  
For example, the statement **x=x+1;** can be simplified to **++x;**  
**Example:**

```java
int test = 5;
++test; // test is now 6
```

The **decrement** operator (--) is used to decrease the value of a variable by one.

```java
int test = 5;
--test; // test is now 4
```

>ğŸ›ˆ Use this operator with caution to avoid calculation mistakes.

# Prefix & Postfix
Two forms, **prefix** and **postfix**, may be used with both the increment and decrement operators.  
With prefix form, the operator appears before the operand, while in postfix form, the operator appears after the operand. Below is an explanation of how the two forms work:  
**Prefix**: Increments the variable's value and uses the new value in the expression.  
**Example:**

```java
int x = 34;
int y = ++x; // y is 35
```

The value of x is first incremented to 35, and is then assigned to y, so the values of both x and y are now 35.  
**Postfix**: The variable's value is first used in the expression and is then increased.  
**Example:**

```java
int x = 34;
int y = x++; // y is 34
```

x is first assigned to y, and is then incremented by one. Therefore, x becomes 35, while y is assigned the value of 34.

>ğŸ›ˆ The same applies to the **decrement** operator.

# Assignment Operators
You are already familiar with the **assignment** operator (=), which assigns a value to a variable.

```java
int value = 5;
```

This assigned the value 5 to a variable called **value** of type **int**.  
  
Java provides a number of assignment operators to make it easier to write code.  
**Addition and assignment (+=):**

```java
int num1 = 4;
int num2 = 8;
num2 += num1; // num2 = num2 + num1
```

**Subtraction and assignment (-=):**

```java
int num1 = 4;
int num2 = 8;
num2 -= num1; // num2 = num2 - num1
```

>ğŸ›ˆ Similarly, Java supports multiplication and assignment (*=), division and assignment (/=), and remainder and assignment (%=).
