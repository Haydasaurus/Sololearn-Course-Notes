# Primitive Operators
During your math class, you are given a task to calculate the perimeter of a circle.  
You decide to write a small program that will take the radius as input, and will calculate and print the perimeter for you.  
The value for Ï€ (pi) is already defined.  
  
**Sample Input**  
4  
  
**Sample Output**  
25.12  

>ðŸ›ˆ The perimeter of a circle is 2Ï€ multiplied by the radius.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		double pi = 3.14;
		
		//your code goes here
		int radius = scanner.nextInt();
		System.out.println(2*pi*radius);

	}
}
```
