# Primitive Operators

  
  
You are a manager a a tour agency and need to determine the distances between cities.  
The given program takes **distance** in meters as input.  
  
**Task**  
Complete the code to output the distance in kilometers and meters each on a new line.  
  
**Sample Input**  
3644  
  
**Sample Output**  
3  
644  
  
**Explanation**  
1 kilometer is 1000 meters, therefore 3644 meters is equal to 3 kilometers and 644 meters.  

>ðŸ›ˆ Use the **/ operator** to calculate the count of kilometers and **% operator** for meters.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
		int distance = read.nextInt();

		//complete the code
		int kilometers = distance / 1000;
		int meters = distance % 1000;
		System.out.println(kilometers);
		System.out.println(meters);
	}
}
```
