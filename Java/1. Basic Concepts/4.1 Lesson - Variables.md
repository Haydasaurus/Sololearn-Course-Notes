# Variables
**Variables** store data for processing.  
A variable is given a name (or **identifier**), such as area, age, height, and the like. The name uniquely identifies each variable, assigning a value to the variable and retrieving the value stored.  
  
Variables have **types**. Some examples:  
- **int**: for integers (whole numbers) such as 123 and -456  
- **double**: for floating-point or real numbers with optional decimal points and fractional parts in fixed or scientific notations, such as 3.1416, -55.66.  
- **String**: for texts such as "Hello" or "Good Morning!". Text strings are enclosed within double quotes.  
  
You can declare a variable of a type and assign it a value.  
**Example:**

```java
String name = "David";
```

This creates a variable called **name** of type **String**, and assigns it the value "David".

>ğŸ›ˆ It is important to note that a variable is associated with a type, and is only capable of storing values of that particular type. For example, an **int** variable can store integer values, such as 123; but it cannot store real numbers, such as 12.34, or texts, such as "Hello".

# Variables  
Examples of variable declarations:

```java
class MyClass {
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		String name ="David";
		int age = 42;
		double score =15.9;
		char group = 'Z';
	}
}
```

**char** stands for character and holds a single character.  
  
Another type is the **Boolean** type, which has only two possible values: **true** and **false**.  
This data type is used for simple flags that track true/false conditions.  
**For example:**

```java
boolean online = true;
```

>ğŸ›ˆ You can use a comma-separated list to declare more than one variable of the specified type. Example: int a = 42, b = 11;
