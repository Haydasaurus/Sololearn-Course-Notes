# Java Comments 
You are given lines of commented code. Uncomment the required lines in order to have a "Java is awesome" output.  

>ðŸ›ˆ Be careful not to uncomment extra lines.

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//uncomment necessary line(s)
		//System.out.println("Java is lame");
			System.out.println("Java is awesome");
		//System.out.println("Please uncomment me!!! ^^");
	}
}
```
