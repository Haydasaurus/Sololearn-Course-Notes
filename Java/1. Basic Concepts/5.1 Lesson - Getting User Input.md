# Getting User Input
While Java provides many different methods for getting user input, the **Scanner** object is the most common, and perhaps the easiest to implement. Import the **Scanner** class to use the **Scanner** object, as seen here:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

In order to use the **Scanner** class, create an instance of the class by using the following syntax:

```java
Scanner myVar = new Scanner(System.in);
```

You can now read in different kinds of input data that the user enters.  
Here are some methods that are available through the Scanner class:  
Read a byte - nextByte()  
Read a short - nextShort()  
Read an int - nextInt()  
Read a long - nextLong()  
Read a float - nextFloat()  
Read a double - nextDouble()  
Read a boolean - nextBoolean()  
Read a complete line - nextLine()  
Read a word - next()  
  
**Example of a program used to get user input:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class MyClass {
	public static void main(String[ ] args) {
		Scanner myVar = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println(myVar.nextline());
	}
}
```

>ðŸ›ˆ This will wait for the user to input something and print that input.  
The code might seem complex, but you will understand it all in the upcoming lessons.
