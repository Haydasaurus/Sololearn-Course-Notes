# Primitive Operators
You need to calculate how many pencils are in the classroom.  
You're given code which takes as input the number of **students** and the number of **pencils** each of them has.  
  
**Task**  
Calculate and output the total number of pencils.  
  
**Sample Input**  
11  
3  
  
**Sample Output**  
33  

>ðŸ›ˆ **Multiply** the count of **students** by the count of **pencils** using the *** operator**. 

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Program
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);
		int pupils = myObj.nextInt();
		int pencils = myObj.nextInt();

		//your code goes here
		int totalNumPencils = pupils * pencils;
		System.out.println(totalNumPencils);
	
	}
}
```
