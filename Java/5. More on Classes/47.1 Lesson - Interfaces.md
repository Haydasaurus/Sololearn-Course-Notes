# Interfaces
An **interface** is a completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods.  
Some specifications for interfaces:  
- Defined using the **interface** keyword.  
- May contain only static final variables.  
- Cannot contain a constructor because interfaces cannot be instantiated.  
- Interfaces can extend other interfaces.  
- A class can implement any number of interfaces.  
  
**An example of a simple interface:**

```java
interface Animal {  
	public void eat();  
	public void makeSound();  
}
```

Interfaces have the following properties:  
- An interface is implicitly abstract. You do not need to use the abstract keyword while declaring an interface.  
- Each method in an interface is also implicitly abstract, so the abstract keyword is not needed.  
- Methods in an interface are implicitly public.

>🛈 A class can inherit from just **one** superclass, but can implement **multiple** interfaces!

# Interfaces 
Use the **implements** keyword to use an interface with your class.

```java
interface Animal {
	public void ear();
	public void makeSound();
}

class Cat implements Animal {
	public void makeSound() {
		System.out.println("Meow");
	}
	public void eat() {
		System.out.println("Omnomnom");
	}
}
```

>🛈 When you implement an interface, you need to override all of its methods.
