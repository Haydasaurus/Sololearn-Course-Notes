# Polymorphism 
**Polymorphism**, which refers to the idea of "having many forms", occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes related to each other through inheritance.  
A call to a member method will cause a different implementation to be executed, depending on the type of the object invoking the method.  
Here is an example: **Dog** and **Cat** are classes that inherit from the **Animal** class. Each class has its own implementation of the **makeSound**() method.

```java
class Animal {  
	public void makeSound() {  
		System.out.println("Grr...");  
	}  
}  
class Cat extends Animal {  
	public void makeSound() {  
		System.out.println("Meow");  
	}  
}  
class Dog extends Animal {  
	public void makeSound() {  
		System.out.println("Woof");  
	}  
}
```

As all **Cat** and **Dog** objects are **Animal** objects, we can do the following in **main**:

```java
public static void main(String[ ] args) {  
	Animal a = new Dog();  
	Animal b = new Cat();  
}
```

We've created two reference variables of type Animal, and pointed them to the Cat and Dog objects.  
Now, we can call the makeSound() methods.

```java
a.makeSound();
b.makeSound();
```

As the reference variable **a** contains a Dog object, the makeSound() method of the Dog class will be called.  
The same applies to the **b** variable.

>ðŸ›ˆ This demonstrates that you can use the **Animal** variable without actually knowing that it contains an object of the subclass.  
This is very useful when you have multiple subclasses of the superclass.
