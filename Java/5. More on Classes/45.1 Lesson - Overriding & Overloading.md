# Method Overriding
As we saw in the previous lesson, a subclass can define a behavior that's specific to the subclass type, meaning that a subclass can implement a parent class method based on its requirement.  
This feature is known as method **overriding**.  
**Example:**

```java
class Animal {
	public void makeSound() {
		System.out.println("Grr...");
	}
}
class Cat extends Animal {
	public void makeSound() {
		System.out.println("Meow");
	}
}
```

In the code above, the Cat class overrides the **makeSound**() method of its superclass Animal.  
  
**Rules for Method Overriding:**  
- Should have the **same** return type and arguments  
- The **access level** cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method's access level (Example: If the superclass method is declared public, the overriding method in the sub class can be neither private nor protected)  
- A method declared **final** or **static** cannot be overridden  
- If a method cannot be inherited, it cannot be overridden  
- Constructors cannot be overridden

>ðŸ›ˆ Method overriding is also known as **runtime polymorphism**.

# Method Overloading
When methods have the same name, but different parameters, it is known as method **overloading**.  
This can be very useful when you need the same method functionality for different types of parameters.  
The following example illustrates a method that returns the maximum of its two parameters.

```java
int max(int a, int b) {  
	if(a > b) {  
		return a;  
	}  
	else {  
		return b;  
	}  
}
```

The method shown above will only work for parameters of type **integer**.  
However, we might want to use it for **doubles**, as well. For that, you need to overload the **max** method:

```java
double max(double a, double b) {
	if(a > b) {
		return a;
	}
	else {
		return b;
	}
}
```

Now, our **max** method will also work with **doubles**.  
An overloaded method **must** have a different argument list; the parameters should differ in their type, number, or both.
