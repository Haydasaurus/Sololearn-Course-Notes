# Type Casting  
Assigning a value of one type to a variable of another type is known as **Type Casting**.  
  
To cast a value to a specific type, place the type in parentheses and position it in front of the value.  
**Example:**

```java
int a = (int) 3.14;
System.out.println(a);
```

The code above is casting the value 3.14 to an integer, with 3 as the resulting value.  
**Another example:**

```java
double a = 42.571;
int b = (int) a;
System.out.println(b);
```

>ðŸ›ˆ Java supports automatic type casting of integers to floating points, since there is no loss of precision.  
>
>On the other hand, type casting is mandatory when assigning floating point values to integer variables.
