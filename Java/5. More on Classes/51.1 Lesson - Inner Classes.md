# Inner Classes
Java supports **nesting** classes; a class can be a member of another class.  
Creating an inner class is quite simple. Just write a class within a class. Unlike a class, an inner class can be private. Once you declare an inner class private, it cannot be accessed from an object outside the class.  
**Example:**

```java
class Robot {
	int id:
	Robot(int i) {
		id = i;
		Brain b = new Brain();
		b.think();
	}

	private class brain {
		public void think () {
			System.out.println(is + " is thinking");
		}
	}
}
```

>ðŸ›ˆ The class **Robot** has an inner class **Brain**. The inner class can access all of the member variables and methods of its outer class, but it cannot be accessed from any outside class.
