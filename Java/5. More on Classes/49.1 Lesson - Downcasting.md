# Type Casting
For classes, there are two types of casting.  
  

## Upcasting
You can cast an instance of a subclass to its superclass.  
Consider the following example, assuming that Cat is a subclass of Animal.

```java
Animal a = new Cat();
```

Java automatically upcasted the Cat type variable to the Animal type.  
  

## Downcasting
Casting an object of a superclass to its subclass is called **downcasting**.  
**Example:**

```java
Animal a = new Cat();  
((Cat)a).makeSound();
```

This will try to cast the variable a to the **Cat** type and call its makeSound() method.

>ðŸ›ˆ Why is upcasting automatic, downcasting manual? Well, upcasting can never fail. But if you have a group of different Animals and want to downcast them all to a Cat, then there's a chance that some of these Animals are actually Dogs, so the process fails.
