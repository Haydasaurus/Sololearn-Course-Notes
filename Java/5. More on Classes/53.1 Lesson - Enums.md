# Enums
An Enum is a special type used to define collections of constants.  
**Here is a simple Enum example:**

```java
enum Rank {  
	SOLDIER,  
	SERGEANT,  
	CAPTAIN  
}
```

Note that the values are **comma-separated.**  
You can refer to the constants in the enum above with the **dot** syntax.

```java
Rank a = Rank.SOLDIER;
```

>ğŸ›ˆ Basically, Enums define variables that represent members of a fixed set.

# Enums  
After declaring an Enum, we can check for the corresponding values with, for example, a **switch** statement.

```java
Rank a = Rank.SOLDIER;

switch(a) {
	case SOLDIER:
		System.out.println("Soldier says hi!");
		break;
	case SARGEANT:
		System.out.println("Sargeant says Hello!");
		break;
	case CAPITAN:
		System.out.println("Capitan says Welcome!");
		break;
}
```

# Enums
You should always use Enums when a variable (especially a method parameter) can only take one out of a small set of possible values.  
If you use Enums instead of integers (or String codes), you increase compile-time checking and avoid errors from passing in invalid constants, and you document which values are legal to use.

>ğŸ›ˆ Some sample Enum uses include month names, days of the week, deck of cards, etc.
