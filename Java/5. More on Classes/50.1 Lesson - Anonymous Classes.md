# Anonymous Classes
**Anonymous classes** are a way to extend the existing classes on the fly.  
**For example, consider having a class Machine:**

```java
class Machine {  
	public void start() {  
		System.out.println("Starting...");  
	}  
}
```

When creating the Machine object, we can change the start method on the fly.

```java
public static void main(String[ ] args) {
	Machine m = new Machine() {
		@Override public void start() {
			System.out.println("Wooooo");
		}
	};
	m.start();
}
```

After the constructor call, we have opened the curly braces and have overridden the **start** method's implementation on the fly.

>ğŸ›ˆ The **@Override** annotation is used to make your code easier to understand, because it makes it more obvious when methods are overridden.

---

# Anonymous Classes  
The modification is applicable only to the current object, and not the class itself. So if we create another object of that class, the start method's implementation will be the one defined in the class.

```java
class Machine {
	public void start() {
		System.out.println("Starting...");
	}
}
public static void main(String[ ] args) {
	Machine m1 = new Machine() {
		@Override public void start() {
			System.out.println("Wooooo");
		}
	};
	Machine m2 = new Machine();
	m2.start();
	}
```
