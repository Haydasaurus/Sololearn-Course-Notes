# Java API
The Java API is a collection of classes and interfaces that have been written for you to use.  
The Java API Documentation with all of the available APIs can be located on the Oracle website at  
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/
Once you locate the package you want to use, you need to import it into your code.  
The package can be imported using the import keyword.  
**For example:**

```java
import java.awt.*;
```

The **awt** package contains all of the classes for creating user interfaces and for painting graphics and images.

>ğŸ›ˆ The wildcard character (*) is used to import all of the classes in the package.
